# Deptective

üïµÔ∏è Deptective is a plug-in for the Java compiler (_javac_) that validates the dependencies
amongst a project's packages against a description of allowed dependences
and fails the compilation when detecting any unintentional dependencies.

## Requirements

üïµ JDK 11 is needed to run Deptective.
Support for JDK 8 may be added later on.

The plug-in is specific to _javac_, i.e. the compiler coming with the JDK, it does not work with other compilers such as the _Eclipse Batch Compiler_ (_ecj_).
Support for _ecj_ may be added [later on](https://github.com/moditect/deptective/issues/2).

## Usage

üïµ Define a file _deptective.json_ which describes the allowed dependencies amongst the project's packages like so:

```
{
    "packages" : [
        {
            "name" : "com.example.foo",
            "reads" : [
                "com.example.bar",
                "com.example.baz"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name" : "com.example.bar",
            "reads" : [
                "com.example.baz"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "whitelisted" : [
        "java.util*",
        "java.swing*"
    ]
}
```

`packages` is a list of `Package` objects.
The `Package` object has a `name` property (fully-qualified name of the described package)
and a `reads` property (list of strings representing the fully-qualified names of other packages read by the given package).

`whitelisted` is a list of strings representing whitelisted packages,
i.e. packages that always can be read by any other package.
The `*` character can be used as a wildcard, so e.g. `java.util*` will whitelist the packages `java.util`, `java.util.concurrent` etc.

_Note:_ access to the package `java.lang` is always allowed.

Place the configuration file in the root of your source directory (e.g. _src/main/java_ for Maven projects).
Alternatively you can specify the location of the config file using the `-Adeptective.configfile` option (see below).

Add _deptective-javac-plugin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar_ to your project's annotation processor path
and specify the option `-Xplugin:Deptective` when invoking _javac_.
When using Maven, the following configuration can be used:

```
...
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <compilerArgs>
                    <arg>-Xplugin:Deptective</arg>
                    <!-- specify options like so -->
                    <!-- <arg>-Adeptective.reportingpolicy=WARN</arg> -->
                </compilerArgs>
                <annotationProcessorPaths>
                    <path>
                        <groupId>org.moditect.deptective</groupId>
                        <artifactId>deptective-javac-plugin</artifactId>
                        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
                    </path>
                </annotationProcessorPaths>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
...
```

See _integration-test/pom.xml_ for a complete example.

### Obtaining Deptective via Jitpack

üïµ Deptective is not yet available in Maven Central.
For the time being, you can obtain the latest snapshot JARs via [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/).
Add the following repository to your project's _pom.xml_ or your Maven _settings.xml_ file:

```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack</id>
        <name>Jitpack</name>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Then reference the Deptective JAR using the GAV coordinates `com.github.moditect.deptective:deptective-javac-plugin:master-SNAPSHOT`.

See _jitpack-example/pom.xml_ for a complete example.

### Configuration Options

üïµ The following options can be provided when running the plug-in:

* `-Adeptective.config_file=path/to/deptective.json`: Path of the configuration file in the file system
* `-Adeptective.reporting_policy=(ERROR|WARN)`: Whether to fail the build or just raise a warning when spotting any illegal package dependencies (defaults to `ERROR`)
* `-Adeptective.unconfigured_package_reporting_policy=(ERROR|WARN)`: Whether to fail the build or just raise a warning when detecting a package that's not configured in the config file (defaults to `WARN`)
* `-Adeptective.mode=(ANALYZE|VALIDATE)`: Whether the plug-in should validate the packages of the compiled package against the _deptective.json_ file (`VALIDATE`) or whether it should generate a template for that file based on the current actual package relationships (`ANALYZE`). The latter can be useful when introducing Deptective into an existing code base where writing the configuration from scratch might be too tedious. Generating the configuration from the current "is" state and iteratively refining it into an intended target state can be a useful approach in that case. Note then when using Deptective via the Maven compiler plug-in, you should make sure to set `<fork>` to `false` and `<showWarnings>` to `true` as otherwise the Maven compiler plug-in will not display the output produced by Deptective. Defaults to `VALIDATE`

## Contributing and Development

üïµ In order to build Deptective, [OpenJDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/) or later and Apache Maven 3.x must be installed.
Then obtain the source code from GitHub and build it like so:

```
git clone https://github.com/moditect/deptective.git
cd deptective
mvn clean install
```

Your contributions to Deptective in form of [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) are very welcomed.
Before working on larger changes, it's recommended to get in touch first to make sure there's agreement on the feature and design.

### IDE Set-Up

üïµ To work on the code base in Eclipse, please follow this steps:

1. Run Eclipse with (at least) Version 2018-12/4.10.0 and make sure it runs with OpenJDK 11
2. In Eclipse, register an OpenJDK 11 instance ("Preferences" -> "Java" -> "Installed JREs") if not already there
3. Then run "File" -> "Import..." -> "Maven" -> "Existing Maven Projects" and select the root folder of this repository.
4. After importing the project, make sure that Java 11 is on the build path of the _javac-plugin_ module
(right-click on that module, then "Properties" -> "Java Build Path" -> "Libraries").

## Related Work

üïµ Different projects exist that analyze Java package dependencies, validate and/or produce metrics on them.
I'm not aware of any tool though that provides instantaneous feedback about any unwanted dependencies right during compilation.
Some related tools are:

* [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) aims at enforcing architectures described in a Java DSL.
In contrast to Deptective it is not executed during compilation but via (JUnit) tests.
* [JDepend](https://github.com/clarkware/jdepend) analyzes Java packages and produces metrics on them.
* The Eclipse Java compiler allows to put access restrictions in place but they can only be used to limit access to types/packages in other JARs on the classpath, not to packages of the current compilation unit itself
